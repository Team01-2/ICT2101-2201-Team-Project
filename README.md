# How to run
- keep it straight to the point of how to access the entry point of the web app
- any necessary dependencies to run it

# Development Workflow
(provide a brief yet sufficiently comprehensive description of your team’s workflow using git and GitHub features)

Using Git, we have created:
1) main branch - the version that is finished developing and tested is pushed to here, Not allowed to be changed unless all group members verified and agreed on the version.
2) dev branch - where we do our development.
3) individual branches - each developer developed and work on thier own personal features in thier own branch

Our Current Structure in Github

# UAT 
## Use Case Diagram

## System State Diagram

## System Test Cases Video
- an embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
- ~3 mins long to cover all system tests

# Whitebox Testing
# Class
- choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. 
- Please do not use an entity class.

# Test cases
- list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
- show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
- provide instructions how to run the test suite
- embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
