# Development Workflow
(provide a brief yet sufficiently comprehensive description of your team’s workflow using git and GitHub features)

Using Git, we have created:
1) main branch - the version that is finished developing and tested is pushed to here, Not allowed to be changed unless all group members verified and agreed on the version.
2) dev branch - where we do our development.
3) individual branches - each developer developed and work on thier own personal features in thier own branch
4) Github Project Board feature to track our progress and tasks allocated during our meetings (https://github.com/Team01-2/ICT2101-2201-Team-Project/projects/1)
  - Backlog (For tracking and documentation purposes)
  - Current To-Do List (List of tasks we have come out with after every meeting with a deadline of when all tasks should be completed by)
  - To-Do List (Tasks related to Website ONLY)
  - To-Do List (Tasks related to Others, E.g Database, Documentations)
  - In Progress (Tasks that are currently on-going)
